# Parity experiment: Digits vs Numerosity

**Disclaimer**: *This is a working repository and so information and code may change.*

## Overview

Many studies highlight that people represent numbers on mental numbers. Evidence of this occurs in the SNARC (spatialâ€“numerical association of response codes) effect, whereby people are faster to respond with left key pressses for small numbers and faster right key presses for large numbers. In a previous piece of work [(Prpic et al, 2023)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-023-02246-w), we investigated whether the SNARC effect interacted with symbolic (digits) and non-symbolci (dots) numerals. Analysis code and data for that experiment can be found [here](https://github.com/courtneygoodridge/DvN_manuscript_analysis). 

The code, analysis, and data in the current respository is a conceptual replication of this previous study. The stimuli, the design and the procedure are the same; the only main difference is the task which consists of a parity judgment (i.e., is the number odd or even?) instead of a magnitude classification (i.e., is the number small or large?). 

## Code and analysis

The `Parity_Analysis_Script.Rmd` analysis script can be found in the analysis folder. In order to run this analysis script, clone the `Parity_DvN_SNARC` repository into your working directory (you can find this by running the here::here() function in the R command line). For more information on using the `here::here()`, see the [documentation](https://here.r-lib.org/). Once the repository is in your working directory, run each chunk of code. The data has been removed for now as this experiment is still ongoing. However, a draft write up of the results can be found in the Manuscript folder, alongside some plots in the Plots folder.
